# üöÄ My Portfolio Backend üåê

Welcome to the **My Portfolio Backend** project! This repository contains the codebase and configuration files that power the backend of my personal portfolio website. Designed with scalability, security, and performance in mind, this backend is a comprehensive showcase of my skills in backend development.

## üåü Features

- **Node.js**: The core of the backend, ensuring fast and scalable server-side operations.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format, making it easy to manage and scale.
- **Mongoose**: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js, providing a straightforward, schema-based solution to model your application data.
- **RESTful API**: A well-structured API that handles requests efficiently and securely, enabling seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access to protected routes and resources.
- **Environment Configuration**: Secure and easy management of environment variables using `dotenv`.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling ensures the application is robust and reliable.
- **Validation**: Input validation is performed using `Joi`, ensuring that data is correctly formatted before being processed.
- **Logging**: Integrated logging with `Winston` helps keep track of application activity and errors, aiding in debugging and monitoring.
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests are written using `Jest` and `Supertest` to ensure the reliability of the codebase.
- **Deployment**: Configured for deployment on cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS, with continuous integration and delivery pipelines using GitHub Actions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **MongoDB** (local or cloud-based instance)
- **Git**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-portfolio-backend.git
    cd my-portfolio-backend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the necessary environment variables:
    ```plaintext
    PORT=8001
    MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
    JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
    ```

4. **Run the server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The server should now be running on `http://localhost:8001`.

### API Endpoints

The following endpoints are available in the API:

- **`GET /api/v1/projects`**: Fetches a list of all projects.
- **`POST /api/v1/projects`**: Adds a new project (authentication required).
- **`GET /api/v1/projects/:id`**: Fetches details of a specific project.
- **`PUT /api/v1/projects/:id`**: Updates an existing project (authentication required).
- **`DELETE /api/v1/projects/:id`**: Deletes a project (authentication required).

### Authentication

Authentication is handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users must provide a valid token to access protected routes. Tokens are generated upon successful login and must be included in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests:

```plaintext
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Error Handling

The application uses a centralized error-handling mechanism to ensure that errors are caught and managed effectively. Custom error messages are returned to the client in a consistent format, and logs are generated to assist in troubleshooting.

### Testing

Unit and integration tests are included to ensure the reliability and correctness of the backend. To run the tests, use:

```bash
npm test
```

Tests cover various scenarios, including API route testing, error handling, and edge cases, ensuring that the application behaves as expected under different conditions.

## üöÄ Deployment

This project is ready for deployment on cloud platforms such as Heroku, AWS, or any other platform of your choice. The repository includes a `Procfile` and environment-specific configurations to make the deployment process seamless.

### Continuous Integration & Deployment

GitHub Actions is set up for continuous integration and deployment. Each time you push changes to the repository, tests will automatically run, and if they pass, the changes will be deployed to your chosen environment.
